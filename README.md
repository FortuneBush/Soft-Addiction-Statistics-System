# Soft Addiction Statistics System
This system is used to record the details of personal time spent in daily life, allowing users to more intuitively recognize that they spend their time every day
## Project Overview

The Soft Addiction Statistics System is a tool designed to record and analyze individual soft addiction behaviors. Soft addictions refer to seemingly harmless habits such as shopping, procrastination, and internet addiction. This system, by managing the consumption of money and time, aids users in identifying and changing their relationship with soft addictive behaviors to achieve a better quality of life.

## Soft Addiction Definition

Soft addictions are seemingly harmless habits that are, in reality, misguided comforts and attempts. They may lead us away from an ideal life, waste money, deprive time, numb perception, dull awareness, and drain energy.

## Distinguishing Soft Addiction from Hard Addiction

The behavior involved in soft addiction itself is not dangerous; the key is our use or misuse of it. Unlike hard addictions, soft addictions are socially accepted and often glamorized. Soft addictions include procrastination, TV addiction, workaholism, emotional fluctuations, binge eating, excessive coffee consumption, impulsive shopping, fantasy indulgence, frequent complaining, and internet addiction.

## Top Ten Soft Addictions

1. Procrastination
2. TV Addiction
3. Workaholism
4. Emotional Fluctuations (e.g., Irritability or Excessive Excitement)
5. Binge Eating
6. Excessive Coffee Consumption
7. Impulsive Shopping
8. Fantasy Indulgence
9. Frequent Complaining
10. Internet Addiction

## Requirements

To overcome soft addictions, the first step is to identify them. By recording the consumption of money and time, users can better understand their soft addiction behaviors. The project includes the following features:

1. Categorically record the user's time and money consumption.
2. Manage categories: add, delete, and modify.
3. Read and analyze various consumption patterns.

## Experiment Requirements

1. **Basic Requirements:** Design a user-friendly interface to help users record and analyze money and time consumption, with information stored in files.

2. **Coding Requirements:** Write readable code with proper naming conventions, reduce redundant code, and consider user operations and possible errors and their solutions.

3. **Innovation Requirements:** Consider the convenience, efficiency, intuitiveness of user data recording, and the visual appeal and personalization of statistical results.

## Project Structure

- **SoftAddictionStatisticsSystemFrm:** Main form class
- **SoftAddictionStatisticsSystemForm.Designer.vb:** Code generated by the form designer
- **README.md:** Project documentation

## Usage

1. Open the Soft Addiction Statistics System.
2. In "Category Management," select the category type (time or money) and add, delete, or modify category names.
3. In "Time Management," add or delete types and durations of time consumption records.
4. In "Money Management," add or delete types and amounts of money consumption records.
5. Click the "Visualize Time and Money Consumption Statistics" button to view the statistical results.

## Notes

- Ensure that the entered data is accurate.
- Exercise caution when modifying or deleting categories and records to avoid affecting statistical results.
